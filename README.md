This repository contains my practical implementations and learning exercises from the book **"AI Agents in Action"** by Micheal Lanham, published by Manning Publications and available on the O'Reilly Learning Platform.

## üìö About This Learning Project

This repository represents my hands-on journey through the concepts and techniques presented in "AI Agents in Action". The book provides comprehensive guidance on building intelligent agents that can interact with real-world systems, make autonomous decisions, and perform meaningful actions.

**Book Details:**
- **Title**: AI Agents in Action
- **Author**: Micheal Lanham
- **Publisher**: Manning Publications
- **Available on**: O'Reilly Learning Platform
- **Level**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Duration**: 9h 2m
- **Publication**: February 2025
